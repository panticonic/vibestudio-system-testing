# Vibestudio system testing

System tests drive real headless agents and retain conversations, tool
invocations, runtime events, cleanup, provenance, and diagnostics. A failing
command starts an investigation, not a report.

## Read by task

| Task | Reference |
| --- | --- |
| Diagnose a run or artifact | [diagnostics and artifacts](references/diagnostics-and-artifacts.md) |
| Author or revise a scenario | [scenario authoring](references/scenario-authoring.md) |
| Select coverage | [scenario catalog](references/scenario-catalog.md) |
| Repair a discovered defect | [self-improvement](SELF_IMPROVEMENT.md) |
| Exercise managed source | [Vibestudio VCS](../vibestudio-vcs/SKILL.md) |

Implementation entry points: `runner.ts`, `test-runner.ts`, `types.ts`,
`stages.ts`, `diagnostics.ts`, and `tests/`. Import suite collections from the
stages entry point, not individual test files.

## CLI repair loop

Use one stable, unique instance ID throughout an investigation.

1. Provision and check infrastructure:

   ```bash
   pnpm system-test --instance <id> doctor
   ```

      Doctor owns creation, readiness, and pairing of an isolated ephemeral
   instance. A missing or unpaired server is not a blocker. Inspect the printed
   supervisor log and repair failed infrastructure before interpreting scenario
   behavior. Never borrow or stop an unrelated instance.

2. List tests only when the exact name is unknown:

   ```bash
   pnpm system-test --instance <id> list --json
   ```

3. Run the smallest exact test:

   ```bash
   pnpm system-test --instance <id> run <test-name>
   ```

      Use `--detach` plus the documented status command for long runs. Treat
   cancellation and timeouts as terminal records whose cleanup evidence must be
   inspected — never add sleeps or extend deadlines to conceal liveness bugs.
   Pass an explicit model only when the model itself is the experiment. Default
   route and quota fallback live in `config.ts`.

4. On non-zero exit, inspect the retained run. A failed run's diagnostics are
   persisted locally when it completes, so this still works after the instance
   that produced it has been recycled — but the trajectory is not, so export it
   before reprovisioning if you need the full transcript:

   ```bash
   pnpm system-test --instance <id> inspect <run-id> --json
   ```

   If that bounded packet is insufficient:

   ```bash
   pnpm system-test --instance <id> trajectory <run-id> <test-name> --full --json
   ```

5. Classify the root cause as infrastructure, documentation, harness, or
   validator. Repair the owning layer — never over-specify the test prompt to
   route around a platform or documentation defect.

6. Run focused conventional checks. Host-code-only changes can use the owned
   source server. Changes under `workspace/` need a freshly provisioned
   workspace copy: stop the managed instance, then rerun doctor.

7. Rerun only affected coverage. Use a prior run's rerun command when several
   failures relate to the same fix. Expand to a category or smoke set only when
   captured evidence justifies it.

8. Stop the exact managed instance:

   ```bash
   pnpm system-test --instance <id> stop
   ```

Never report completion while an owned instance, panel, page, or inspector is
still live. Stop only for missing credentials, required new authority,
unavailable external infrastructure, or an unauthorized server restart — not at
an artifact path or validator message.

## Drive the system directly before spending an agent turn

`vibestudio vcs <method> --session <name> --input '<json>'` reaches every
semantic method on a provisioned instance — including `walk`, `query`, and
`search` — in about two seconds and without a model in the loop. Attach a probe
session once (`vibestudio agent attach probe`) and use it to answer "does this
surface work at all" before writing or rerunning a scenario. An agentic run is
the right instrument for *whether an agent can find and use* a capability; it is
a slow and nondeterministic way to learn *whether the capability functions*.

## Orchestrator and test subject

Use `HeadlessRunner` or `TestRunner` only to orchestrate tests. If the prompt
asks the current agent to exercise a capability and return evidence, it is the
test subject — use that capability's normal skill and API. Never recursively
spawn a system-test agent.

Each ordinary test gets an isolated context. Multi-actor behavior belongs in a
declared orchestration with independent sessions. Source-changing cases must
declare the required repository fixture type; fixture setup and cleanup use
public semantic VCS and stay outside the user-like prompt. See the authoring
reference for exact fixture and authority contracts.

## Agentic and deterministic layers

System testing is the agentic layer: a model selects skills and tools, judged by
semantic validators. `@workspace/testkit` is the deterministic layer for exact
assertions, panel automation, viewport checks, and runtime supervision.

Use deterministic coverage directly when model judgment is unnecessary. Use both
layers when an agent must discover and perform a workflow whose effects can be
asserted exactly.

A completed turn is not a quality verdict. Inspect trajectories for confusion,
unnecessary source search, repeated failures, and poor recovery even when
validators pass. Preserve recovered tool failures as product or documentation
evidence.

Prompts describe realistic user goals and observable outcomes — never internal
tools, API expressions, configuration objects, validator markers, or required
call sequences. Put exact wire checks in deterministic probes.

## Programmatic orchestration

Use `HeadlessRunner` from `runner.ts`, `TestRunner` from `test-runner.ts`, and
suite exports from `stages.ts`. Keep full results in eval scope and return only
bounded summaries. Read those public types for callbacks, concurrency,
cancellation, and retained results.

Headless runs have no panel-only tools. Identity, model route, approval mode,
fallback, and test authority come from the sealed runner policy — userland
subjects must not inject or widen it. Credential setup waits are infrastructure
failures in unattended tests; repair through the canonical connection flow.

Use separate instances for parallel workspace experiments and separate agent
sessions for concurrent eval work. Never interpret a closed orchestration
socket, mailbox delay, or still-running eval as a slow model without checking
retained lifecycle and transport evidence.

## Authoring and validation rules

- Follow typed lifecycle phases and structured errors; never parse explanatory
  prose for control flow.
- Keep primary operation failure separate from cleanup, rollback, and transport
  evidence.
- Test panel slot commitment separately from boot readiness and rendered
  correctness. Use exact lifecycle waits, not sleeps.
- Let repository fixtures claim their declared scheduler resources — never add
  undeclared parallel publication against protected main.
- Preserve ordinary authority and cancellation through publication and cleanup.
  A test policy authorizes only its declared case resources.
- Keep fixture mechanics, cleanup coordinates, and validator knowledge out of
  the subject prompt.
- For semantic VCS cases, validate the public workflow and recorded identities,
  decisions, moves/copies, counteractions, provenance, and typed recovery — not
  an implementation-specific sequence.
- Workers and DOs normally follow the test context; panels need an explicit
  context ref when unpublished code is under test.

## Artifact security

Run artifacts default to the profile's `vibestudio/system-test-runs/<run-id>`
with restrictive permissions unless an output directory is supplied. Full
trajectories can contain sensitive data — never publish them, paste them
wholesale, or weaken permissions. Extract only the bounded evidence needed to
explain the mismatch.

The orchestrator can run from eval, workers, Durable Objects, or panels. Use the
authorized runtime participant identity — never invent a synthetic participant.
For trusted app failures, read [app development](../appdev/SKILL.md). For host
source repair, use [SELF_IMPROVEMENT.md](SELF_IMPROVEMENT.md).
