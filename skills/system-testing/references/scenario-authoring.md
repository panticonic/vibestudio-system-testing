# Scenario authoring

## Test a user goal

Write prompts at the user's level: state the desired outcome and constraints
that would be known to the user. Do not prescribe final evidence fields, an
exact method sequence, response schema, error branch, or workaround. The agent
must discover the relevant skill and demonstrate that the documented system is
usable.

Good prompts expose documentation and ergonomics defects. Answer-bearing
prompts hide them.

## Judge the agent; diagnose the trajectory

An ordinary agentic case's automated row is a transport/lifecycle outcome: the
turn finished and produced a final response, or explicitly reported that it
could not complete the task. It is not a quality score. Do not duplicate the
implementation in a mechanical validator or require status-marker syntax,
ceremonial fields, redundant observations, exact object layouts, or one
preferred tool choreography.

When the outcome has objective facts independent of the agent's prose, select
`validation: "agent-evidence"` and validate those facts. Examples include a
saved clean workspace state, a successful build, the model identity that ran a
child task, or absence of leaked owned resources. Accept any product path that
establishes the outcome; do not turn the evidence gate into call choreography
or a style score. This is the normal complement to a vague user prompt: product
guidance teaches the behavior and independent evidence proves it happened.

The harness records tool failures independently from task completion and marks
every ordinary agent trajectory for review. Review failed calls (including
caught eval failures), retries, unusually long trajectories, cleanup errors,
and runtime diagnostics even when the agent ultimately succeeds. Also look for
needless searching, repeated rediscovery, and work abandoned after consuming
time. These are ergonomics findings: inspect the full trajectory and repair the
platform, documentation, or tool surface that made the sensible path difficult.

Keep exact schema/effect assertions in `@workspace/testkit`. Use
`validation: "harness"` only when the case is explicitly a deterministic or
wire-protocol probe rather than a model-judgment task.

## Grade the capability in two halves

A validator that reads only the final message collapses two independent
questions — did the mechanism deliver what the task needs, and did the agent use
it — into one red result that tells you neither. It also drifts into demanding a
phrasing, which grades the sentence rather than the behavior. Observed cases:
an agent that reported "it was increased once, then reverted" failed a check
requiring `already|previously` within eighty characters of `reverted`; an
inventory that named two of three coordinates and their count failed a check
requiring all three filenames, one of which only existed because a *setup* agent
had happened to obey a naming instruction.

Write each case as:

- **the surface half, exact** — assert against the tool result: the walk kind
  that ran, the evidence its rendered block carried, the number of coordinates a
  cohort actually produced, the hit count a search returned, the absence of a
  typed failure. This half is machine-checkable and its failure means the
  mechanism broke.
- **the agent half, deliberately loose** — one discriminating token that only an
  agent which used the evidence could produce. Not a conjunction of three, and
  never a required sentence shape.

Order the checks so the sharpest diagnosis reports first: transport failure,
then missing evidence, then the agent's use of it. A failing case should name
which half broke, because "the mechanism is dead" and "the mechanism worked and
the agent ignored it" are different findings with different owners — and the
second is often the more valuable one.

Two anti-patterns worth naming. Do not let the answer be reachable without the
surface under test: if the reason is written into a file comment, an agent can
grep its way to a pass and the case grades reading rather than recovery. And do
not assert a boundary the system does not have — a case built on a premise the
product deliberately rejects measures nothing, however green or red it goes.

## Isolate tests

Ordinary tests use fresh headless contexts. Tests that create or publish
workspace source must select a typed repository fixture:

- `CONTENT_WORKSPACE_REPO_FIXTURE` owns an empty `projects/...` content repo.
- `BUILDABLE_PACKAGE_WORKSPACE_REPO_FIXTURE` owns a `packages/...` repo seeded
  with the canonical minimal manifest and source entry.
- `BUILDABLE_EXTENSION_WORKSPACE_REPO_FIXTURE` owns an `extensions/...` repo
  with a trusted extension manifest, source, icon, and focused failing test.
- `BUILDABLE_APP_WORKSPACE_REPO_FIXTURE` owns an `apps/...` repo with a terminal
  app manifest, source, icon, and focused failing test.
- `OPTIMIZABLE_PANEL_WORKSPACE_REPO_FIXTURE` owns a minimal `panels/...` repo
  with a deliberately wasteful but behaviorally trivial bundle.

The harness imports that repository as one exact snapshot into a fresh task
context. Setup does not publish it. A fixture that never reached main disappears
with its context. If task events reached main, teardown finds the newest one by
intersecting the exact first-parent task line with paged current-main history.
It counteracts only that published work, newest first, in a fresh context, then
commits and pushes once. Extra task-authored repository identities are removed
by the same causal walk and reported as scope failures; newer unpublished work
is left to task-context destruction. Refer to the harness-provided fixture; do
not put cleanup commands, fixed shared names, or seed instructions in prompts.
The fixture also supplies both protected-effect rules: main publication and
repository deletion, exact for a seeded repo or section-prefixed for an owned
task-created/derived repo. Teardown must use those rules through ordinary VCS;
never add a cleanup-only transport or ignore an approval failure.

Multi-actor behavior belongs in `TestCase.orchestrate`. The first/base-author
role runs in the fixture task context and publishes the shared base through the
ordinary product workflow; later roles get independent contexts rooted at the
then-current main. Give each session a normal user goal. The orchestrator may
sequence phases, but agents must not spoof another context or write private
state directly.

## Exercise approvals without bypassing them

`TestCase.authorityPolicy` is a host-attested fixture for the ordinary
production authority path. List each gated/critical capability and each
userland subject the scenario expects. Capability names use an explicit
`{ kind: "exact", key }` scope by default. Use
`{ kind: "prefix", prefix }` only when the capability suffix itself is
production-authored at runtime; pair it with a resource scope that independently
confines the exact fixture source/class or other stable production boundary.
Resource and userland rules use `ResourceScope`:
prefer `{ kind: "exact", key }`; use `{ kind: "prefix", prefix }` only when the
production subject is intentionally dynamic, such as the digest-bearing
`user.exec.*` namespace or an agent-chosen Durable Object key beneath one exact
randomized fixture source and class. Keep the prefix at the narrowest stable
semantic boundary; dynamic identity below that boundary is production
behavior, not a reason to guess a preferred key in the prompt.

The receiver still constructs the real approval request and resolves it
through the normal approval service. The policy supplies the unattended user's
answer; it is not an alternate API or a blanket auto-approve switch. An
unmatched request must remain `EUNEXPECTEDTESTPROMPT`. Never compute a
test-only subject, patch the extension to skip approval, or weaken the
production gate for harness convenience.

The runner, not individual scenarios, owns the execution policy: the chosen
model, `approvalLevel: 2`, and disabled fallback are mandatory case facts.
They follow the host-attested context through trusted infrastructure and apply
to every downstream agent created there. `TestCase.authorityPolicy` only
describes expected capability decisions and cannot override the
execution model.

The canonical workspace test runner exposes the provider capability
`native.tests.execute`. A scenario that intentionally runs focused workspace
verification must declare the exact provider capability prefix (including the
provider path and definition-digest separator) and the test-runner receiver
resource. Do not broaden either namespace or replace it with blanket
auto-approval.

For corrective workflows, inspect the complete trajectory rather than folding
it through a bespoke response schema. An earlier `needs-decision`, failed build
report, or guarded close remains useful ergonomics evidence even when a later
integration, verification, or close succeeds.

## Semantic VCS scenarios

VCS scenarios are user tasks that exercise protocol behavior, not
API-recitation tests. Before authoring them, read
`../../vibestudio-vcs/SKILL.md` and the relevant references.

Cover these distinct invariants:

- every mutation names the exact observed working state;
- commit consumes the complete local application chain;
- incoming changes are incorporated through small local decisions until the
  source event is accounted for, then committed with that source parent;
- push publishes one exact clean event against one observed main event;
- protected push rechecks the affected build/typecheck closure; a deliberate
  `BuildGateFailed` case must inspect every returned diagnostic, prove that no
  ref advanced, repair the cited source, recommit, and retry;
- move preserves file identity while copy mints identity and records ancestry;
- revert creates counteracting changes instead of erasing history;
- provenance walks directly among content, changes, work, commands, events,
  and the exact trajectory invocation that caused a command;
- blame follows immediate coordinate mappings rather than a flattened author
  field;
- `RevisionChanged` causes re-observation and a new command ID, while an
  uncertain identical request is retried with the same command ID.

Keep status, whole-chain commit, push, incremental integration, move/copy,
causality/blame, revert, freshness, and idempotency separately diagnosable.
Do not rebuild a parallel release-scenario registry beside the live `TestCase`
catalog.

## Expected failures

Negative tests should identify the expected typed refusal and verify that no
state changed. Mark deliberately induced failures as expected in diagnostics so
they remain evidence without becoming product-defect counts.

Never branch a validator on human-readable error prose when a discriminant or
terminal outcome exists.

New tool-failure scenarios must also verify the durable
`agent-tool-failure.v1` object on the terminal invocation: stable code/kind,
operation and stage, causal IDs when available, retry policy, and primary versus
cleanup ordering. When the scenario creates a scaffold or fork, require
`preflight.ok === true` before accepting publication evidence. A recovery
scenario must call `recoverProjectPublication` from the recorded failure and
prove no second repository edit or commit occurred.
